## Pro

I am a passionate and results-driven **Front-End Developer** with a strong focus on creating intuitive, high-performance user experiences. My core technical skills lie in **JavaScript** and the **React** ecosystem, where I've leveraged component-based architecture to build scalable and maintainable applications.

I thrive on translating design concepts into pixel-perfect, accessible, and responsive web applications, always seeking out best practices to optimize performance and developer efficiency.

## Beyond the code

This interest in understanding user motivations and cognitive processes subtly informs my approach to UX design, helping me build interfaces that are not just functional but genuinely delightful to use. When I'm looking to disconnect, you can often find me immersed in the imaginative worlds of science fiction movies.

## Active Pursuits

To balance the hours spent in front of a screen, I prioritize a variety of physical activities. I find the challenge and focus of rock climbing to be a perfect mental reset, and I enjoy the rhythmic discipline of swimming. I also love the team dynamics and competition of various sports, regularly participating in games like table tennis (TT), cricket, and football. These pursuits reinforce the importance of agility, strategy, and teamwork, attributes that are just as valuable in developing high-quality software as they are on the field.
