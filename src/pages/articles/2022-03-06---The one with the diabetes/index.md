## Did we need diabetes? ü©∫

Apparently we(humans) did need diabetes at some point in history just to survive.
Do you remember as a kid or adult watching the movie **Ice Age.**
Is it possible that the earth's surface was covered with ice for a very long time - absolutely yes. But is it possible that humans wittnessed it - unfortunately yes.

> **Fact**: Most of the contents in the book series **A song of iceüßä and fireüî•** is based on actual historical events.
> If you've seen GOT, you could remember the famous qoute **The winter is coming**. The thing about the quote is, it actually happened. Nothern part of the world supossedly suffered from severe winters which lasted for decades, and humans have survived it.
> With no idea how long it will last üìÜ, and the weather being really tough on us(humans), we still managed to survive.

But how?ü§î

Just imagine, you're in a cold placeü•∂. What happens first? You start to shiver, your finger tips and toes gets cold and then numb.
Funny thing is during survival threats human body decides which organ is more important than the other. So it cuts off blood flow to our arms and legs at the first sign of trouble.

This is irrelevant to the above story, but still - In the mid nineties, a medical term called **Cryonics** got really popular and people actually beleived that it could be possible one day in the future.
According to wikipedia, _"Cryonics is the low-temperature freezing and storing of human bodies, with the speculative hope that resurrection_ üßü _may be possible in the future."_ But freezing causes any liquid to crystalize and so did blood.

Back to the story, if humans have to survive the freezing cold, then our blood should be stopped from crystalizing.

> **Another Fact**: According to GOOGLE: "Plain water freezes at 32 degrees F, but when sugar, or salt, or other solutes are dissolved in it, the freezing point gets lower. The standard 4:1 solution starts freezing at 26-27 degrees F." which is around - 3 C.

So as to survive the cold our body found a way to decrease the freezing point of the blood. By increasing the blood sugar levels and that's how the human species ended up with the most common chronic disease of our current generation.

This behaviour was also discovered in some other living species as well so hopefully we are not aloneü§û.
_Ice wine was supposedly created by accident 400 years ago, when a German vintner‚Äôs crop was hit by a sudden frost. The grapes were shrunken and yielded much less juice, but when he pressed them, they were incredibly sweet. The shrunken nature of the grapes was due to water loss, which plants evolved to do in order to protect themselves from freezing. The increased sugar concentration is for the same reason, as sugar is a ‚Äúnatural antifreeze.‚Äù_

Once a survival mechanism is now a multi-billion dollar indutry ü§ë.
